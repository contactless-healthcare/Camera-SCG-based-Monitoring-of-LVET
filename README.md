# Camera-SCG-based-Monitoring-of-LVET
This is code repository for the paper "Camera Seismocardiogram based Monitoring of Left Ventricular Ejection Time".

This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF.

In this study, data were collected from 21 subjects, with each subjectâ€™s data acquisition session lasting approximately 8 minutes. A camera-SCG dataset was created, comprising 21 subjects with 9616 entries. Each entry encapsulates fixed-length LSM-LF, LSM-HF, AO, AC, LVET and subject ID.

(Our codes and datasets will be released soon! ! !)
